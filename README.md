## 🧩 GUI + PIN Authentication Workflow (Compact Version)

This diagram shows how a user interacts with the POS Agent Tracker with GUI and PIN authentication:
[Start Application] | v [PIN Authentication] | +----+----+ |         | Correct    Wrong |         | v         | [Main POS GUI Menu] <----+ | Add Transaction       | | Daily Summary         | | Monthly Summary       | | Export Daily Report   | | Export Monthly Report | | Exit                  | +-----------------------+ | v [Add Transaction] | Input Type | Amount | Cash Box/Wallet | Description | Calculates Charge & Profit | v [Update Database] | v [Show Summary / Export Reports] | v [Exit Application]

3. **Automatic Calculations** – Charges and profits calculated automatically on each transaction.  
4. **Daily & Monthly Summaries** – View business totals instantly.  
5. **Export Reports** – Save CSV files for auditing, reporting, or tax purposes.
