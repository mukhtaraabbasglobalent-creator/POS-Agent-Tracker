# 💳 POS Agent Financial Tracker System

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **POS Agent Financial Tracker System** is a fintech support application designed to help POS agents and small business owners record daily transactions, automatically calculate service charges, and monitor business cash flow in a structured and transparent way.

- Maintain **total business money records** (cash box + wallet)
- Provide a simple system that can support future **financial reporting and tax analysis**
